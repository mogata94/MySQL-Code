The preliminary MySQL analysis of several CSV files that were developed into a KPI centric dashboard for executives to understand 
the companyâ€™s best and worst areas. The orders and shippers tables were used to determine if shipments were delivered late and by 
which shipping service. The order details, products and product category tables were used to determine sales information such as 
most profitable product, most sales by category or total sales including discount rates. The customers and employees tables were 
used in addition to sales information to determine best customers and highest performing employee.

Over the few years of data, year 2014 was the most profitable with more than $425,000 in total net. The top customer over the same
time period was QUICK-Stop and the best-selling product was Cute de Blaye. Margaret Peacock generated the most revenue and the 
beverages category did the best. Federal shipping delivered packages on time the most at 94% and Speedy Express cost the least on 
shipping at an average of $65 per order.
